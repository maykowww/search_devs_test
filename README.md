## Acknowledgements

- For this project, I chose to use ReactJs and the build turbo (https://www.turbo.build) in integration with vite (https://vitejs.dev), for reasons of performance and agility when managing the project's architecture.
- For the styles I didn't choose any ready-made css framework I used styled-components to develop a more dynamic css and have the maximum control over the style and standardize the project in the most effective way possible.
